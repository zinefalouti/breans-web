         content="This example demonstrates how to use the Breans Neural Network to classify banana 
         quality based on several measurable factors. It shows how to prepare the dataset, 
         design a network with multiple layers, train it using SGD, and make predictions. 
         The example highlights the neural networkâ€™s ability to handle categorical outputs 
         and deliver confidence scores."

         By defining weather states and their transition probabilities, the model simulates likely sequences 
         of weather conditions over time. It showcases how Markov Chains can capture temporal dependencies in categorical data."

         a dataset containing air quality, pollution, and respiratory health data. It displays the dataset's 
         head, tail, and statistical summary, applies label encoding to a selected categorical column, and 
         generates a concise report. The modified dataset is then saved as a new CSV file."
